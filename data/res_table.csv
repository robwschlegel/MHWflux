GM GSL and MAB onset tend more positive.,This value is all over the board. It likely only coincides with MHWs due to something else.,FALSE
Prec – evap (cumulative),p_e_cum,Strong negative and positive,Normal,Flat with positive tail,Spring then Summer strong negative onset. Autumn strong positive onset and decline.,GSL tends negative for decline while others tend positive. Very large ranges overall.,There is an important signal in the differences between Spring-Summer and Autumn.,TRUE
Air Northerly,v10,Three hump,Normal distribution,Three hump,Large spread for all seasons with Autumn tending towards positive for onset and decline.,Not much difference. NFS tends a bit more towards positive onset and decline than others.,"There are some signals in there, but they are not clear.",FALSE
Air Easterly,u10,Slight positive,Normal distribution,Slight negative,Least amount of range in Autumn onset.,GM tends to have the least range and be the most negative for onset and decline.,Slight positive onset and slight negative decline imply this vaguely shows a thermal gradient.,FALSE
Wind speed,wind_spd,Normal but flat,Normal,Negative,Autumn onset tends positive while everything else tends negative. Summer decline more negative.,GM and MAB tend more negative for decline.,A smol signal for the GM and MAB showing decline negative with wind speed.,FALSE
Total cloud cover,tcc,Normal but positive,Normal but positive,Normal but positive,Spring onset tends most positive.,GM and NFS full tend more positive. MAB decline tends more positive.,Meh.,FALSE
Total cloud cover (cumulative),tcc_cum,Strong positive with negative tail,Normal,Negative and positive,Autumn onset tends much more positive. Spring decline tends more negative.,Large ranges in onset. GSL tends much more negative for decline.,May be important for GSL events due to SWR importance there.,FALSE
Mean sea level pressure,msl,Strong negative with positive tail,Slight negative to normal,Even with positive tail,Autumn is much more negative for onset and decline. Spring and Summer onset tend positive.,GM and NFS more positive for decline.,Decrease in MSLP is often important for the onset of events,TRUE
Mean sea level pressure (cumulative),msl_cum,Strong negative and positive,Normal but flat,Strong positive with small negative tail,Full range in onset and decline for all seasons except positive Spring onset. Autumn onset tends negative.,"Full range for all. GM decline tends positive. CBS onset tends negative, NFS and SS onset tend positive.",Stronger signals than for MSLP non-cumulative.,TRUE
Sea surface height,ssh,Even throughout,Slight negative,Positive tail,Autumn onset and decline tend negative.,GM decline positive.,The strong positive signal for decline implies a height anomaly (i.e. an eddy) leaving the area.,TRUE
Current Northerly,v,Normal but flat,Normal distribution,Positive with small negative tail,Not much difference. Winter onset tends more negative.,GM onset and decline tend more positive.,Meh.,FALSE
Current Easterly,u,Normal with positive tail,Normal distribution,Slight three hump,Autumn decline tends positive while Summer tends negative.,NFS onset tends most positive.,Possibly something there for onset of events in NFS.,FALSE
Current speed,cur_spd,Flat but slight negative,Normal but negative,Flat but negative,Autumn onset tends to be positive while everything else tends negative.,GSL decline tends much more negative while MAB decline tends positive.,The positive decline for MAB implies the importance of advection for events.,FALSE
Sea surface salinity,sss,Strong negative with positive tail,Negative,Strong negative with positive tail,Summer then Autumn tend more negative. Largest range on Winter.,GSL much more negative for onset+full+decline. CBS onset strong negative. GM decline strong negative.,Strong negative mixed in with noise. Large differences between regions.,TRUE
Mixed layer depth,mld,Strong negative with positive tail,Negative,Strong negative with minor positive tail,Strong negative decline for all but Summer. Summer onset negative with large Spring and Winter range.,Strong negative for all but CBA and SS with large range. All negative onset but large ranges.,The decline of a MHW in Summer or the onset in Winter + Spring doesn’t seem as tied to MLD.,TRUE
Bottom temperature,bottomT,Strong positive with minor negative tail,Normal but flat,Strong positive with small negative tail,Large ranges with strong positive Autumn onset.,Strong positive onset for MAB + GM. CBS decline tends negative.,MHWs in Autumn generally have high bottom temps at onset,TRUE
Latent heat flux,mslhf_mld,Strong positive,Positive,Strong positive,Very strong positive onset+full+decline for Autumn. Large range in onset+decline in Spring.,Strong positive onset for MAB.,"This variable is almost always important for onset and decline, especially in Autumn.",TRUE
Sensible heat flux,msshf_mld,Strong positive with negative tail,Flat,Strong positive with minor negative tail,Strong positive onset for Autumn + Winter and negative for Spring + Summer.,Some difference in tendency but similar ranges for all regions.,Very large differences in negative or positive correlations based on seasons.,TRUE
Longwave radiation,msnlwrf_mld,Strong positive with minor negative tail,Slight positive,Flat with positive tail,Positive onset tendency with Autumn much stronger. Spring + Summer decline tend negative.,Strong positive onset for MAB + GM. ,Autumn may be significantly different from Spring.,TRUE
Shortwave radiation,msnswrf_mld,Negative with strong positive tail,Slight negative,Positive and negative,Strong negative onset for Autumn. Large range for everything else.,Strong negative onset for GM but largest spread for MAB.,"A decrease in SWR in Autumn leads to MHWs, implying cloud cover or some other LHF mechanism.",TRUE
Net heat flux,qnet_mld,Very strong positive,Positive,Strong positive with minor negative tail,Autumn has strongest positive onset+full+decline. Spring decline has large range with negative tendency.,MAB strong positive onset + decline. All others tend positive with larger range in decline for GM.,All regions and seasons tend strong positive but with some notable outliers.,TRUE
