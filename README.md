# MHWflux

The code repository for the "Drivers of Marine Heatwaves in the Northwest Atlantic: physical processes of onset and decline" manuscript. Please visit the [project page](https://robwschlegel.github.io/MHWflux/) for an in depth guide through the methodology. This is a [workflowr](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/) project, meaning it has built-in version tracking information. A shiny app allowing for interactive exploration of the results may be found [here](https://robert-schlegel.shinyapps.io/MHWflux/).
